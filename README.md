# GPS-Guided-Robot
A gps guided robot developed for graduation project.
It's currently using; NEO M8N for location tracking, 
                      QMC5883l to determine heading, 
                      2 BTS7960 motor drivers to drive two DC gearmotors,
                      an arduino mega to run the code.
It currently lacks any way to set waypoints, communicate with outside to get the location information of outer edges of the area, and a way to avoid objects.
Currents plans are to use ultrasonic for object avoidance.

Warning: This is a test branch of the project. You push commits here.
